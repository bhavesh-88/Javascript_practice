    Implement a function processOrderList that:

    • takes 3 arguments: an order list orderList, a number orderld, and a string state that is either "Processing" or
    "Delivered". orderList is an array of order objects. An order object has the following schema:

    {
    id: Number,
    state: String
    }

    • updates the order list depending on the state and returns the updated list.

    • If the state is 'Processing', it updates the object in the list having id as orderld, to have the state
    'Processing'.
    • If the state is 'Delivered, it deletes the object from the list having the id of orderld.

    • If there is no order with the given orderld then the function returns the list orderList unchanged.

    NOTE: You can assume that initially, all orders in the list have a state of 'Received.

    The implementation will be tested by a provided code stub and several input files with parameters. The function will
    be called and the result printed to the standard output by the provided stubbed code. The stubbed code first creates
    a list of orders in Received state. The status of all orders in the updated order list are printed after all the
    operations are completed. If the final list is empty, the stub code prints 'All orders are in Delivered state'.

    <script>

        function processOrderList(orderList, orderId, state) {
            const updatedOrderList = [...orderList];

            const orderIndex = updatedOrderList.findIndex(order => order.id === orderId);

            if (orderIndex !== -1) {
                if (state === 'Processing') {
                    updatedOrderList[orderIndex].state = 'Processing';
                } else if (state === 'Delivered') {
                    updatedOrderList.splice(orderIndex, 1);
                }
            }

            return updatedOrderList;
        }

        // Example usage:
        const initialOrderList = [
            { id: 1, state: 'Received' },
            { id: 2, state: 'Received' },
            { id: 3, state: 'Received' }
        ];

        const updatedOrderList = processOrderList(initialOrderList, 2, 'Processing');
        console.log(updatedOrderList);

        // The output should be:
        // [ { id: 1, state: 'Received' }, { id: 2, state: 'Processing' }, { id: 3, state: 'Received' } ]
